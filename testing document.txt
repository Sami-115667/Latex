    \item \textbf{Negative Testing:} Include test cases that cover invalid inputs and unexpected user actions.
    \item \textbf{Branching Points:} Identify conditional statements, loops, and function calls in the code and design tests that cover all possible outcomes based on those branches. 
\end{itemize}





\section{Integration Testing}
At this stage, we conducted meticulous testing of subsystem interfaces and module interactions to identify and localize any errors or issues. Using a top-down approach, we evaluated modules in descending order of hierarchy, following the data flow from higher to lower priority subsystems. This comprehensive methodology ensured a rigorous and professional evaluation process.
